The following text is from Jane Austen's 1811 novel Sense and Sensibility. Elinor lives with her younger sisters and her
mother, Mrs. Dashwood.
Elinor, this eldest daughter, whose advice was so effectual, possessed a strength of understanding, and coolness of
judgment, which qualified her, though only nineteen, to be the counsellor of her mother, and enabled her frequently to
counteract, to the advantage of them all, that eagerness of mind in Mrs. Dashwood which must generally have led to
imprudence. She had an excellent heart;—her disposition was affectionate, and her feelings were strong; but she knew
how to govern them: it was a knowledge which her mother had yet to learn; and which one of her sisters had resolved
never to be taught.
According to the text, what is true about Elinor?
A. Elinor often argues with her mother but fails to change her mind.
B. Elinor can be overly sensitive with regard to family matters.
C. Elinor thinks her mother is a bad role model.
D. Elinor is remarkably mature for her age.
ID: 3543e6e2 Answer
Correct Answer: D
Rationale
Choice D is the best answer because it provides a detail about Elinor that is established in the text. The text indicates that
although Elinor is "only nineteen," she gives good advice and exhibits such a high level of understanding and judgment that
she serves as "the counsellor of her mother." Thus, Elinor is mature beyond her years.
Choice A is incorrect because it isn't supported by the text: although the text says that Elinor advises her mother and often
counteracts her mother's impulses, there's no mention of Elinor arguing with her mother or failing to change her mother's
mind. Choice B is incorrect because it isn't supported by the text: although the text mentions that Elinor has strong feelings,
it doesn't indicate that she's excessively sensitive when it comes to family issues. Choice C is incorrect because it isn't
supported by the text: there's no mention of what Elinor thinks about her mother and no suggestion that she thinks her
mother is a bad role model. Because she's described as having "an excellent heart," Elinor likely doesn't think ill of her
mother.

    passage: 'Elinor, this eldest daughter, whose advice was so effectual, possessed a strength of understanding, and coolness of judgment, which qualified her, though only nineteen, to be the counsellor of her mother, and enabled her frequently to counteract, to the advantage of them all, that eagerness of mind in Mrs. Dashwood which must generally have led to imprudence. She had an excellent heart;—her disposition was affectionate, and her feelings were strong; but she knew how to govern them: it was a knowledge which her mother had yet to learn; and which one of her sisters had resolved never to be taught.',
    options: [
      { letter: 'A', text: 'Elinor often argues with her mother but fails to change her mind.' },
      { letter: 'B', text: 'Elinor can be overly sensitive with regard to family matters.' },
      { letter: 'C', text: 'Elinor thinks her mother is a bad role model.' },
      { letter: 'D', text: 'Elinor is remarkably mature for her age.' }
    ],
    correctAnswer: 'D',
    explanation: {
      basic: 'The correct answer is D. The text shows that despite being only nineteen, Elinor serves as "the counsellor of her mother" and demonstrates remarkable understanding and judgment.',
      detailed: 'Elinor is described as having "strength of understanding, and coolness of judgment" that qualifies her to be her mother\'s counselor despite being only nineteen. This shows she is mature beyond her years.',
      expert: 'The passage establishes Elinor\'s exceptional maturity through the contrast between her age ("only nineteen") and her role as family advisor. The text uses phrases like "strength of understanding" and "coolness of judgment" to emphasize her wisdom, while noting her mother "had yet to learn" the emotional control Elinor already possesses.'

    questionText: 'When fashion designer Lloyd Henri Kiva New opened his store in Scottsdale, Arizona, in 1945, he quickly became known for creating delicately crafted leather goods, like belts and hats. He was perhaps most renowned for his colorful handbags, which he made by hand using a long and painstaking process. As he gained more customers, New began using sewing machines and other tools to help him produce bags more efficiently, though he continued to handcraft the crucial details that made each bag unique.\n\nBased on the text, what would have been the most likely consequence if New had not begun using sewing machines?',
    passage: '',
    options: [
      { letter: 'A', text: 'He would have been unable to ensure that each bag included unique, handcrafted details.' },
      { letter: 'B', text: 'He would have struggled to meet the increasing demand for his bags.' },
      { letter: 'C', text: 'He would have had to individually design each bag he produced.' },
      { letter: 'D', text: 'He would not have been able to generate as much interest in his bags.' }
    ],
    correctAnswer: 'B',
    explanation: {
      basic: 'The correct answer is B. The text states that New gained new customers and used sewing machines to produce bags more efficiently, so without machines he would struggle to keep up with demand.',
      detailed: 'The passage explains that as New gained more customers, he adopted sewing machines to work "more efficiently." This implies that without this efficiency improvement, he would have difficulty meeting the increased demand from his growing customer base.',
      expert: 'The text establishes a causal relationship: growing customer base → need for efficiency → adoption of sewing machines. The logical inference is that without the efficiency gains from mechanization, New\'s handcraft-only approach would create a production bottleneck, making it difficult to satisfy increasing market demand.'
